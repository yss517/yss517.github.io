I am a tenure-track Associate Professor at the Institute of Statistics and Big Data at Renmin University of China (RUC). Prior to joining RUC, I worked as a quantitative trading researcher on Wall Street, specializing in fixed income and equity trading. My primary research interests include statistical inference for high-dimensional data, distributed learning, multi-task learning, reinforcement learning, and quantitative trading of financial assets.
