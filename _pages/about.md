I am a tenure-track Associate Professor at the Institute of Statistics and Big Data, Renmin University of China (RUC). I earned my bachelor's degree in Statistics from Beijing Normal University in 2013 and my Ph.D. in Statistics from The Pennsylvania State University in 2018. Prior to joining RUC, I worked as a quantitative trading researcher at two hedge fund firms on Wall Street, specializing in fixed income and equity trading. 

My primary research interests include statistical inference for high-dimensional data, distributed learning, multi-task learning, and quantitative trading of financial assets.
